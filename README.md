FAQs:

- Why must google drive?

Because GitHub has a file limit of 25 MB per file, most data, including log files, needs to be split into chunks and packaged in 7z format.

- Have you tried restarting the computer to stop the game?

Yes, I tried it and it didn't work.

- Have you tried the pre-release/release versions as well?

Yes, I tried running it on other versions as well and it didn't work.
